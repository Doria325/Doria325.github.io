              <p><em>“When we are surrounded by nature, a feeling of comfort comes over us and our bodies become relaxed. Most of us would intuitively recognize this feeling, but until recently we haven’t had any evidence to prove it.”--Yoshigumi Miyazaki</em></p>
<p>Gardens have long been an expression of culture, philosophy and artistry in numerous countries around the globe. In Asia, gardens are especially a representation of national spirit and cultural heritage. Several gardens are considered significant historic landscape and architecture, part of the World Cultural Heritage. Chinese gardens and Japanese gardens are two popular types of gardens known for their charming and elegant designs that create a scaled-down world of nature.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese gardens are inspired by philosophy and religion.The use of water, plants and rocks express the infinite meaning of nature through a symbolic way while allowing adventurers to release their stress, improve concentration with the power of being surrounded by the pleasantness of nature. Both gardens demonstrate the concept of “borrowed scene,” which utilizes objects from far and near to create pleasing images from any spot on any angle of the garden and express continuity. The ultimate principles of aesthetics in the two gardens is to imitate nature and by creating landscapes in miniature. Although both types of gardens share similar elements, some characterizing features and slight differences in details shape Japanese and Chinese gardens to two distinctive styles.</p>
<h2 id="japanese-gardens">Japanese Gardens</h2>
<p>Early Japanese gardens are inspired by Chinese gardens to a very large extent. Philosophical and spiritual elements together with concepts of Buddhism and Taoism introduced from China to Japan in the 6th century formed the initial aesthetic principles of Japanese gardens.<br>

<p>Architecture in Japanese gardens emphasizes minimalism, often uses very few colors which are less vibrant, in gray tone, and focuses on presenting the natural beauty of the structure and materials. The choice of materials focus on simplicity and the natural patterns and texture. These choices are reflected on stone doors, Suikinkutsu (water basins) and lanterns. Lanterns are also regular elements which add harmony and balance to the garden. Japanese gardens may have Chashitsu (tea house), meditation halls or sitting areas but few in number and have less diverse style of appearances. These buildings are mostly built with wood due its abundance as a resource, also because of the country’s religion, Shinto, that views trees as divine, even after being cut as wood it is still a living being.</p>
<p>Water bodies are exquisitely compacted, such as small streams and ponds, focusing on presenting the sense of flow and liveliness of water. Water flows with the wind or elevation throughout the garden. Water bodies, fountains and water sounds create a calm vibe and represent renewal and continuity. This is an important element in both Japanese and Chinese gardens, but what I often found in Japanese gardens but not in Chinese gardens is the use of small streams that flow in corners throughout the garden. Japanese gardens do not emphasize the existence of water due to the geographic location of Japan as an archipelagic country and therefore have a greater focus on and fear of water. This can be seen in the use of sand and pebble stones in Karesansui formed in shapes of waves to represent water and islands.<br>

<p>While designers pay great attention to the overall look of the landscape in Chinese gardens, more efforts are spent on the details. Each placement of the object should be deliberately designed. For example, Japanese gardens often show their essence of beauty through rocks. In fact, the selection and placement of rocks and stones is a type of art often containing specific rules and meanings. For instance, one important element, Karesansui, is a type of Japanese garden style and miniature landscaping, consisting of fine sand and stones that are designed carefully in detail. The detailing of Japanese gardens is the finishing touch, and the attention paid to the smallest things, such as a branch or mosses on a stone, is extremely important. The level of detail in garden construction and the positioning of objects is especially reflected on patterns formed from stones and inconspicuous illustrations curved on rocks. Karesansui, which is a common scene in Japanese gardens, drives visitors to immersion through the art of stone placements.<br>

<p>Japanese gardens are very much inspired by Zen, a Japanese sect of Mahayana Buddhism. The belief of Zen is “elimination,” eliminate possessiveness, utilitarian thinking, obsession of the past and look towards ourselves to reflect our real individuality. Inspired by Zen, the overall style of Japanese gardens emphasizes simplicity, serenity, elegant and contemplation of natural landscapes.</p>
<h2 id="chinese-gardens">Chinese Gardens</h2>
<p>Chinese gardens are significant pieces of Chinese arts and culture. The purpose of gardens changes from eras, designs also evolve throughout history. Starting from the Han dynasty, gardens were typically built in abodes for emperors to rest in the beauty of natural landscapes. These gardens eventually became popular tourist attractions. Today, we can still see traditional Chinese gardens in the homes of some residents.<br>

<p>One striking difference between the two types of gardens is that Chinese gardens also typically have more buildings, such as different rooms to study, read, entertainment and a diverse type of architecture, including pavilions, pagodas, gazebos, small houses to break up sections in the garden, allowing each window and angle to show a distinct view from within. The Moon Gate is also a distinctive architectural feature of Chinese gardens that we cannot see any other types of gardens. Additionally, these architectures usually are more glamorous with rich ornaments and colors. Unlike Japanese temples and tea houses that have straight and overhanging roofs, Chinese gardens tend to have eccentric sloping rooflines. In general, structures in Chinese gardens are mostly round and use mostly curved lines. For example, roofs of temples and pavilions show more sinuous variations of lines like a dragon. From a distance, it looks like a blooming vibrant flower, standing proudly with its head held high in the garden, as if everything around it is foil. On the other hand, buildings in Japanese gardens are mostly in quadrilateral form and use cleaner, straighter lines. Buildings tend to be shorter. Rather than compete for attention, they are more inclined to blend with the natural environment. Therefore, they do not have as powerful aura as Chinese architecture, but are exquisite and look more elegant.</p>
<p>Water bodies are mostly wide to emphasize vastness, therefore mostly are lakes and larger ponds. Unlike Japanese gardens, Chinese gardens tend to make water bodies more obvious for visitors, such as small falls with rockeries instead of small streams. Lakes are often the central focus in Chinese gardens. These water forms often come together with complex, exotic and bold rockeries. Rockeries in Chinese gardens look very different from exquisite stones in Japanese gardens. They are sculptured as artificial mountains from individual stones in peculiar, porous shapes and symbolize a concentration of natural energy. Stones in Chinese gardens tend to imitate the forms of mountains as well as their imposing grandeur. This choice also reflects the Chinese pursuit of Shan Shui, which is translated to “mountain and water,” referring to landscape.</p>
<p>Similar to how Japanese gardens have strict rules in the placement of rocks, Chinese garden plants have clear meaning in particular locations for placement. For example, bamboos should be planted behind the house, osmanthus should grow in front of the hall, peonies in flower beds, parasols beside the staircase, lilies and lotus bloom in ponds.<br>

<p>Chinese gardens aim to express gloriousness. Designers consider how the placement of each object, far and close, creates beauty from any angle the viewer stands from. Composition of objects should reveal closer to reality, for example, creating similar appearances as falls and mountains in nature. Chinese gardens aim to create harmonious and aesthetic compositions from anywhere in the garden, therefore designers pay great attention to the overall look of the landscape.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-of-culture">Reflection of Culture</h2>
<p>Garden is an individual’s interpretation towards nature. Due to differences in philosophy and religion, Chinese and Japanese gardens express varying emotions and meanings. The Chinese national aesthetics pursues the variety of architecture and livelihood, while Japanese aesthetics emphasizes wither and silence. Such differences shaped one to captivating one and another to a simpler and exquisite one. As the famous garden designer Chen, Cong Zhou said, <em>&quot;Chinese gardens reveal nature within the artificial, while Japanese gardens reveal the artificial within nature.&quot;</em> The highlights of Chinese gardens is how natural sceneries, their essence and beauty are shown through the imitations of mountains and lakes. On the other hand, Japanese gardens convey the beauty of nature through the attention of artificial details and carefully planned designs. Gardens, showing differences in how seemingly insignificant details are depicted creates dissimilar vibes, reflecting the uniqueness of nations and cultures.</p>
