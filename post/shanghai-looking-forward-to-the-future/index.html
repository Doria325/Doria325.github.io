              <p>Architecture preservation is defined by the process of restoring or maintaining buildings, structures and other physical elements of the built environment that holds significant historical or cultural means. But what is it that we are attempting to keep? Is it only limited to the spatial dimensions of places? Architecture preservation includes the historical narratives, values and culture behind the physical building. Through these old structures, we conserve a bridge that connects the present to the past by stories embedded in their walls that remind us of our collective past and unique identity. They shape the present community, and continue to inspire the future as symbols of resilience and endurance, reminding the shared values and history. However, under rapid modernization and urban expansion, should we lean to the past or look toward the future?</p>
<h2 id="what-i-see-in-shanghai">What I see in Shanghai</h2>
<p>Architecture preservation in Shanghai has gone through several stages. Policies evolved over time due to difficulties in identifying what to preserve. Shanghai is one of my favorite cities in China. Although I have been there numerous times, my curiosity towards this city never quite diminished. I like walking along The Bund in the evening. Looking to my left are the futuristic skyscrapers, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai Tower, flashing glaring, colorful lights. On my right are the Custom House, China Merchant Bank–historic buildings constructed under western colonial influence. The Bund allows the past and the present of Shanghai to exist at the same time. Separated by river, stories of the eastern and western culture echo from the two shores. Yet, old stories beyond the neon lights are even more treasurable.</p>
<p>During my spring break in 2025, I went on another trip to Shanghai. I spent a day on a city walk, starting from Wukang Mansion, followed by Wukang Rd. all the way to Anfu Rd., crossed Wulumuqi (M) Rd. and arrived at Huaihai (M) Rd. On this route are iconic old Shanghai tree-lined streets guarded by sturdy, tall, century-old sycamore trees. The mottled barks and bare branches form a dense canopy, creating a tunnel effect, feeling like walking through a time travel tunnel that takes me back to the 1800s French Concession. Trees do not reveal a strong sense of historic and western culture atmosphere without the red and yellow-brick houses at the sides. Most of them are old houses preserved or refurbished from the last century.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>My main purpose of walking along this route was to shop through the fancy clothing stores, boutiques, cafes, bakeries etc, but I noticed that some museums and historic sites were hidden behind the tall brick walls. Historic sites like the Former Residence of Ba Jin, Soong Ching-ling Memorial Residence are places I would not go specifically but I'd be glad to stop by and have a look. A lot of the old, western-style buildings were also renovated to be designated for commercial purposes, such as the House of Rong Family that was turned into Prada showroom after restoration. These places still remained as where they were–now turned into light commercial buildings and districts were like selections of a history book intersected in people’s daily lives.<br>

<p>Another place that surprised me was the National Museum, the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party. It is a monument standing in the center of a large, busy commercial district, known as Xin Tian Di, surrounded by malls, stores, restaurants. Looking above, glass skyscrapers in the distance stand straight up to the sky. It is surely an important historical site, as you can tell from guards securing the exterior of the building. However, I never expected that such a place could appear right at the center of one of the most popular, crowded commercial plaza in Shanghai. Although such a location has been criticized for losing its historical authenticity, I guess I would have never known this building if I did not explore around Xin Tian Di, searching for ice cream and fragrance stores.<br>

<p>This surprise led me to further research about a special housing type in Shanghai. The Shikumen (defined as “Stone Gate” in Mandarin) Lilong is a distinct type of architecture in Shanghai that blends Chinese and Western structural styles. Lilong houses were first constructed in the 1840s to accommodate the overflowing migrants. It is a densely connected lane-based housing compound formed by Shikumen houses. Shikumen Lilong housing intertwines urban life and community culture through its dense and interconnected layout that blends private and public space to promote social interaction in common alleys. It is a heritage architecture that shows the way of living in early Shanghai. Siwen Li, one of the largest clusters of Shikumen Lilong (now in Jingan District) sheltered 2,700 families in 700 Shikumen houses at its peak occupancy. Today under accelerating urbanization, preserving massive Shikumen Lilong as it was in the last century is unreasonable. However, their figures can still be seen across streets of modern Shanghai. The Xintiandi and Tianzifang blocks are renewed Shikumen Lilongs that now function as commercial districts that shape the modern cityscape of Shanghai. They allow Shikumen Lilong to gain more opportunities to be presented to the world and  represent an alternative approach of preserving architectural heritage, which eventually formed the cultural identity of Shanghai.<br>

<h2 id="illustrating-the-future-using-the-past">Illustrating the Future Using the Past</h2>
<p>The method of combining modernity and commercialization with historical, cultural heritage to bring a new  atmosphere to a city left a deep impression on my trip. If not because the district is now commercialized by popular stores, I would have not passed by the historic sites nor the aged traditional houses. I believe a similar perspective applies to most people. When they are hidden or blending in commercialized and modernized areas, more people would be naturally attracted, allowing these architectures to complete their mission of sharing continuous, old stories. On the old streets of Shanghai, these historical heritages are not like artifacts displayed in a museum, but rather, their essence as architecture–to serve for the livelihood of citizens–was preserved by an operation that blended them with the modern city. Eventually, preserving the past allowed Shanghai to build its very own unique city image both in the present and the future while developing a stronger connection between inhabitants and the city.<br>
Architecture preservation is not about simply protecting the structure from windsweep and sunburn. In fact, heavy protection can trap the essence of art. As we try to keep the stories of the past in the present and take them to the future, we sometimes forget that buildings are preserved so they can serve our future, but not to make our future about working for the buildings, keeping the past as it is. The ultimate goal of preservation is to pursue a better life, shape a better future.</p>

<p>And above here is the first article for my new series: <strong>&quot;City Exploration.</strong>&quot; Unlike previous articles, a lot of the ideas discussed here are my <strong>subjective thoughts</strong>, therefore, <strong>contents may not be entirely accurate</strong>. In fact, I consider this more like a travelogue. Recently, I try to think and reflect on my observations during my travels. Writing this travelogue sparked so many inspirations and questions: How do Shanghai residents think about the preserved architectures? Did architecture preservation benefit the community economically? What is the difference between Shikumen Lilong and Beijing Hutong? But I guess I'll have to leave these questions for the next articles.</p>
<p>Hope you find this reading interesting and I'll try not to keep you waiting too long for the next one！</p>
