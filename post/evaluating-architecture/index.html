              <p>In contemporary society, architecture is an indispensable part of our lives: we wake up in a building; when we walk out of our house, we are surrounded by architecture—our lives are intertwined with it. Today, architecture transcends mere cityscapes, embodying the aesthetic aspirations and life philosophies of individuals. When evaluating and critiquing architecture, we analyze its social implications and explore diverse aesthetic perspectives and opinions that reflect our unique individuality.<br>
There exists an &quot;objective&quot; method of evaluating the effectiveness of a building through the perspectives of Function, Economy, and Beauty (FEB). Function evaluation includes the measurement of safety, construction quality, sustainability, durability, comfort, and whether the architecture meets the client's requirements. Economic evaluation questions whether the money spent to achieve the desired functions is reasonable and minimized to its highest extent. The evaluation of beauty considers how aesthetically pleasing and attractive the architecture is to its audience while harmonizing with its surroundings. Although there is a set of rubrics and criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of architecture, different voices, opinions, and critiques towards a building are inevitable.<br>
The Oriental Pearl Tower located in Shanghai, China, is an example of a controversial architecture. Standing by the river, the entire structure tends to picture an imagery of shining pearls. Undeniably, the Oriental Pearl Tower is a historical and significant symbol of China and Chinese culture, but there has been numerous debates about whether or not it is a “good” building.<br>
“The top of the tower should offer the best view of Shanghai, but closer sites like the Bund are not visible.” (“Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower - Shanghai Attraction.” Www.chinaodysseytours.com, www.chinaodysseytours.com/shanghai/oriental-pearl-tower.html.)<br>
The evaluation of the function of the tower has been slightly controversial, but the most debatable criticism is its aesthetic concern.</p>
<p><em>“The styling is rustic, the color of concrete is dated.” (JJ Ying, Zhihu, December 21, 2021)<br>
“An important aesthetic criterion for a city's skyline is that it is memorable, and in this light, the Oriental Pearl, which serves as the ‘captain’ of Lujiazui, is certainly a successful building.”<br>
“Pearl of the Orient seemed advanced in concept at the time, but now it may look a bit oddly styled and not quite matching the Shanghai World Financing Center, Jinmao Tower and Shanghai Tower.” (Silentale, Zhihu, October 21, 2022)<br>
“All I can associate it with is two meatballs on a skewer. The three-legged stand at the base of the tower is so confining and abrupt that it disrupts the rhythm of the whole building. It's the same effect as if an upright man had been standing very sparsely and then had a rope tied around his knees.” (Di, Wang, Zhihu, October 25, 2022)</em></p>
<p>Before researching for comments on the Pearl of Orient, I did not expect it to be such a controversial architecture and its design raising debatable discussions among the public. As someone who has visited The Bund and the Pearl of Orient several times, I made more compliments than criticism regarding the aesthetics towards this symbol of Shanghai. The structure of Pearl of Orient stands out from Lujiazui. It emphasizes round shape while all other buildings show stiff straight lines, breaking down the rigid geometric combinations. Similarly, the use of bright red color adds an attraction to Lujiazui while all other architectures are in a cool, glass exterior. As a popular and representative color in China, this choice also highlights Chinese culture, shaping the architecture as a significant symbol of China. These factors discussed as criticisms by some voices are what I consider as elements that sculptured the Pearl of Orient as the postcard, an impression of China remembered by the world, which makes it a successful and effective architecture that has transcended the meaning it is initially bestowed with.<br>
However, after considering the disagreements, I try to evaluate this architecture as if this is my first sight. Obviously, this is not possible, since the Pearl of Orient has created a deep and influencing impression on me. But it is true that some of its flaws are magnified, and the criticisms are now voices that remind me of reasons why this can be considered as an ineffective architecture. Now evaluating the architecture based on the mentioned criticisms, I understand that disregarding its surroundings and location, just merely looking at the tower does not set off its glamorous Chinese style. The bottom legs of the tower are slightly abrupt. However, afterall, they would not change my impression towards this architecture. I still consider the Pearl of Orient as a successful tower that represents Shanghai and China.<br>
The change in my comments shows how varying perspectives influences one’s evaluation. Observing architecture from more than one angle can provide us with a more comprehensive judgment of a building, however, this does not tremendously change our impression and evaluation towards the architecture. Taking the Pearl of Orient as an example, my first impression of this building was formed when I was a kid, before I even learned its significance, influence and diverse commentaries. That is why, even after absorbing different opinions, my evaluation would not change, proving it to be a true and precise judgment from myself. What makes our evaluation pure and accurate, is that there are no other factors to consider, other than one’s intuitive point of view.<br>
Today, there are so many voices that distract us from feeling the true impressions from architecture. Information from the media tends to give us an evaluation of a building before we develop our own judgments, setting stereotypes of what is “good.” These information eliminates our development of realistic evaluations and forms vague impressions. Although there are criterias for evaluating architecture, what weighs more are the unique impressions and intuitive emotions we develop. To practice forming our purest and most precise judgments, begin by understanding and confronting the feelings we perceive from our homes and surroundings. By building and listening to our own opinions on our lives, we build confidence in understanding architecture.  Prioritize personal impressions, emotions, and memories as the foundation of our judgments, rather than relying solely on media messages.Or go ahead to personally experience and observe architecture with unaided eyes, immersing ourself in the reality of the built environment.</p>
