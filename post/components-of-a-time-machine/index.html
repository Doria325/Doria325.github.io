              <p>There is this spectacular place in cities, where it takes you on a journey to another spot in the world, or invites you on a time travel. If you are feeling interested in this magical journey or just simply lacking ideas on how to spend your next weekend, feel free to open your maps and plan a visit to a museum!</p>
<p>Museum is a collection of arts, culture and history. Displayed works often include historical artifacts, therefore it preserves cultural heritage and historical narratives. Some museums are also intended for educational purposes, such as natural and science museums. Museums are almost a must-see in every city I visit. As one of my favorite places, I believe they are where we can learn the most about a city and showcase a large portion of its beauty. Especially in European countries, they demonstrate their artistic commitments through museums, such as the Louvre Museum and British Museum. Museum is a depository of arts, from the inner displays to every block of construction.</p>
<h2 id="design-features">Design Features</h2>
<p>Note that museums not only serve for the people and the city, but also the artifacts, reciprocating the needs of educators, researchers and artists. The planning must consider an interesting layout for the displayed collections and a fluent circulation through spaces that enhance interaction between the exhibits and visitors, and spaces for wander and immersion. To achieve such purposes, the design of museums must follow some general guidelines (Walshaw):</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>Museum, which welcomes visitors disregarding age and cultural background, must provide equal and proper accessibility to all. Every corner of the building should be able to accommodate any kind of visitors in the same routes, with and without disabilities. Disabled facilities must be constructed on every floor. Lifts should be paired with staircases.. The planning of the museum must comprehensively consider how it should be fairly accessible and safe to all.</p>
<h3 id="display-and-communication">Display and Communication</h3>
<p>With current advancement in technology of visualization, there are more options to be considered regarding how to foster interaction between exhibits and visitors. Most museums enforce no-touch policy, but there are numerous mediums to enhance communication between collections and visitors. These mediums may include screens, graphic displays, laser projections and speakers. They are tools that allow visitors to explore more about the topic while creating an atmosphere and immersing themselves in the artistic or historical mood. Most museums also feature theaters where visitors can delve deeper into specific subjects through educational films and presentations.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>Museum collections are very sensitive to the conditions of surroundings, including humidity and temperature. For example, oil paintings should be preserved under high humidity and avoid direct sunlight. Some wax sculptures must be preserved in colder room temperature, 10-20 degree celsius. Museums must be carefully designed with proper climate conditions for both display and storage of collections to protect and preserve artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="circulation">Circulation</h3>
<p>Museums have the power to tell stories by showing the past. This means that sections of the story must be arranged in a correct order for visitors to understand.The exhibition hall of the museum must be designed in a way that allows visitors to travel to any corner and lead them to a specific route that provides the best experience. The entrance must provide a clear guidance to the location of each section as well as service spots. Signage is used for visitors to identify their priorities and what they are more inclined to see.</p>
<p>The circulation of the museum could be in linear form, where there is a clear starting point and ending point. Visitors do not pass through anywhere repetitively throughout the route. The circulation could also be in loop form, where visitors arrive back to the starting point after finishing the route. Other options also include the division of room sections based on particular themes. The planning of circulation is a decisive factor that directly impacts the experience of visitors. A successful circulation should create a step-by-step guide that leads visitors through each section of the exhibition being connected and concentrated on the whole process without feeling skippy. I often find it interesting that the planar layout would always lead me on an arranged order of exhibits based on a storyline. While I am immersed on the beauty of displayed artifacts, I am unintentionally following the route suggested by the designer. What I like about visiting museums is how they are designed in a way that allows me to only concentrate on the appreciation of arts, culture and history, where my mind escapes the reality and loses the focus on what is happening around me.<br>

<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>
<p>Museum lighting is an extremely complex technical work (to the extent that I might write another article focusing on it in the future). Most of the time, only artificial light is used inside the museum and on displayed artifacts. The UV of sunlights and traditional lamps can damage artifacts very quickly, therefore LED is a more ideal light source as it does not create IR and UV (Sylvania). Different kinds of materials of the exhibits also have varying sensitivity to light. Textiles, furs, old photographs, watercolors and stamps are very sensitive to light, prefer 50 lux. Stone ceramic, glass and metal are less sensitive to light, therefore can endure up to 300 lux (Sylvania).</p>
<p>The utilization of light highlights the texture, color and shape of exhibits for finer observation. For example, narrow beam accent lights sheds high illuminance, focusing the center attention of a space. Wall washing light is used to illuminate larger artworks by using wide beam lights to broadly spread across a wall. This kind of lighting often comes with larger exhibits, which light covers on the entire surface, ensuring all details are visible. Wall washing light also makes the room more spacious. With uniform distribution, the room will also feel more spacious, open and inviting (Sylvania). This lighting eliminates contrasts between highlights and shadows, therefore offering a more complemented view of the exhibit. With numerous different types of lights intended for varying purposes, it is crucial to deliberately plan the arrangement of lights as it impacts both the protection of exhibits and the experience and mood of visitors.<br>

<h2 id="highlights-and-uniqueness">Highlights and Uniqueness</h2>
<p>Internal planning is indeed the core of museum design, but we can see that a lot of thoughts are also endowed in the exterior design. The external architecture design of museums may be symbolic, reflecting the theme and mission of the museum. To exemplify, the design of the Modern Museum of Art in New York appears in a contemporary architectural design structure, with glasses as the construction material covering a large area of the building. The urban-style building expresses similar modernity vibes as the 20th–21st century collections of paintings, sculptures, and photographs displayed. On the other hand, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is close to a neoclassical architecture, built with white bricks. The museum has a large, impressive central dome that dominates its silhouette. The cracks in the bricks exude a sense of nostalgic elegance. This matches the ancient fossils exhibited inside, taking visitors back to the Mesozoic era. The exterior of the museum has an essential role in creating the imaginary world and its correlating atmosphere, starting from the outside of the entrance. The appearance of the museum is a sign that informs visitors about the journey that they are about to embark on.<br>

<p>Moreover, my perception is that the structure's appearance also has a significant impact on the experience of visitors. The aesthetic appeal and thoughtful design of the building enhance the memorable and inspiring adventure through its halls. A museum is a place filled with the essence of art and history, from the interior to the exterior. Only a visually stunning and thoughtfully designed outer shell can harmonize with the expressive ambiance within.  For example, The Getty--a museum constructed on rocky hills--exemplifies how geographic environment can enliven and characterize architecture. One of the most interesting parts I had in my visit in The Getty was riding on a shuttle train that takes visitors from the entrance, located at the foot of the hills to the exhibition halls at the top of the rocky hills. Outside the windows of the train, one side is the overlook view of downtown LA and mountains wrapping around the city, and another side are the decorative plants and rocks. The way the terrain is utilized as a significant component of the museum has become one of the unique features of The Getty. In The Getty, not only the paintings and sculptures are artworks, but the architecture itself has allowed the journey of art appreciation to begin at the entrance gate of the museum.<br>

<p>Conceiving a unique architectural design creates a focal point, a source of local pride in a community, and focuses attention on historical artifacts and artwork collections. History and arts are invaluable footprints of humanity that deserve to be showcased under a brighter spotlight. While a museum's unique design attracts visitors to appreciate its architectural beauty, it simultaneously highlights the stories within. In this way, architecture acts as a bridge that introduces the cultural, historical, and educational narratives housed inside. It invites curiosity and engagement, drawing people in not just to admire the structure itself, but to explore the rich collections and exhibits it shelters.</p>
<p>Museums transcend being merely spaces to display collections. The layout of spaces, the travel of light, and the selection of materials greatly influence the perception and interaction between visitors and exhibits. Each carefully planned component plays a crucial role in creating an atmosphere that fosters connection and communication between individuals and collections, thereby enriching our appreciation of historical and cultural heritage. Ultimately, museums serve to preserve history, art, and culture, providing an immersive experience akin to time travel. By analyzing the meticulous choices in interior design and unique architectural features, we gain insights into how space shapes our understanding and appreciation of art and history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Space will only have a life when people enter it. So the important role architecture can play, and that space plays within that architecture, is to encourage an interaction between people, between people and the ideas being presented in the paintings and sculpture, and most importantly between people themselves.”--Tadao Ando</p>
