              <p>A few months ago, I had the opportunity of experiencing being a Bruin for three weeks, which is definitely one of the most special experiences I ever had. I was able to develop a more insightful understanding in architecture through the lectures, engaging with enthusiasts in this field and the process of building my first project. This article is a process journal that records my growth by working on this project and reflections I have.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-initial-brainstorming">Stage 1: Initial Brainstorming</h2>
<p>The instructions received for working through the first stage was to create a model of any form we want by choosing at least 2 or more provided materials having dichotomies that produce contrasting effects. Examples include hard and soft textures, rigid and fluid states, industrial and artificial materials and more. Meant to attain quantity over quality, this stage was mainly intended for us to explore our creativity. Although instructors encouraged us not to focus too much on the requirements, I still felt constrained choosing dichotomies, materials and the form of my model because pictures of exquisite models shown during the orientation kept flashing in my mind.</p>
<p>Straw was the first material I picked, considering it as a familiar material common in my daily life and looking easier to manipulate. I started by cutting them into equal smaller pieces and experimented very randomly on how they can form a structure. Inspired by Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium (maybe because I watched too many concert videos), I arranged the straws in a wavy, circular form like a blooming flower using a combination of black and transparent straws. My goal was to show the dichotomy of fluid and rigid by using stiff material to create a shape that reveals softness and fluidity. It was until completing the first layer of transparent straws that I suddenly thought of attaching the second layer using black straws, thinking if I can make the structure “float.” Hence, I think the dichotomies of opaque and transparent now match more with my model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is how my model looks like half-way completed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Completing this first model immersed me into the mood of crafting a bit more, so the production of the next models went a bit more fluent. The goal of this stage was really about experimentation, so I tried to make models in very distinctive forms. Starting off was difficult for me, because I had always been used to completing tasks with specific requirements and instructions. Confronting creativity is not easy; it requires us to break through the cage we trapped ourselves with from fear of failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Model 2.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the model that I am most satisfied with. I see irregularity in it and the style of modernity. It reminds me of structures in sci-fi films–structures that require us to take a second and closer look to understand its form and how it was built. In this model, I like how subtle connections between pieces create an illusion as if some upper layers are floating by themselves. I identified it as a strength, which led me to my next steps of revision.</p>

<p>In the second stage, we were informed that our architecture is designated to be placed in the courtyard of Perloff Hall, the UCLA architecture department building. Building on the strengths and my interests from Model 2.1, I wanted to emphasize the feature of suspension. Just like what I did in Model 1.1, the combination of black and transparent straws enhances this illusion. By using transparent straws, I tried to make some sections seem detached from each other and hover independently in the air, challenging viewers’ perception of gravity.</p>
<p>I inserted wood sticks through some straws to create alignments with the materials and the direction of the hallway poles of Perloff. In this way, I try to enhance the connection between my architecture and its environment.</p>
<p>Reflecting on myself and from peer feedback, I think my strength at this point was being able to identify the style and aesthetic features I want to present. Yet, I have also identified some flaws I want to fix. Moving into the finalizing stage, I want to clarify the functions of my architecture and think about how I can alter the form of my model to blend it well with Perloff.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-breaking-through-the-cage">Stage 3: Breaking Through the Cage</h2>
<p>I try to list out some clashing elements that create the visual detachment between Model 2.2 and the environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Simple Problem Analysis Chart</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having problems identified more clearly, I decided to make adjustments to the material and shape. I gave up black straw, the material I have been sticking with all the way and replaced it with wood sticks. In this way, I altered the industrial style to a more natural one. But I still used the transparent straws to keep the detaching and floating illusion I discovered.<br>

<p>FInal Model Elevation View</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To blend it more with its environment, I also changed the interaction technique from alignment to extension. Instead of growing upwards in a cone-like shape, I built my final model with more horizontal expansion to fill the courtyard space and have some parts laid on the roof of the hallways. By doing so, I think the architecture looks like it’s grown from the Perloff building and it now has a tighter connection with its environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Final Model Perspective View</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming to these changes was not simple. It took me days to arrive at the solution of changing the material because I was stuck with the black straws for nearly the entire process, too focused on it to the extent that I have forgotten about the other materials available. Once again, I trapped myself in a cage I built. Finding the way to break through can be simple but hard to spot.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Final Model Close View</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the final design gradually taking shape and some environmental features clarified, it became somewhat natural for me to see its  function as a space like a garden for leisure and refreshment. I observed that a lot of students in the summer program often hang out in the courtyard during breaks, but there are limited sunshades that allow them to hide from the scorching sun in LA, especially at noon. Thus, I imagined it as a garden with shady tree shades that creates a space for refreshment and leisure. Building a more comprehensive understanding of the environment allows me to picture a clearer image for my architecture.<br>

<h2 id="reflecting-on-my-growth">Reflecting on My Growth</h2>
<p>Serving as my first try of being an “architect,” my experience at UCLA TeenArch Summer Program was novel, interesting but also challenging. I had to constantly apply critical thinking skills when arriving at each step to identify flaws, weaknesses and come up with solutions and ways to improve. The process also allowed me to realize the need of being observant to daily lives and my surrounding environment, as I am once again reminded, that the primary purpose of architecture is to serve the people.</p>
<p>I used to think of myself as an uncreative person, but going through this process helped me to find strategies to jump out of the box built by unnecessary rules I set for myself. For me, finding my creativity was the biggest obstacle I overcame and what brought me the hugest sense of accomplishment. Here is a quote that I really like from one of the presenters in my studio during our final review:<br>
<em>&quot;Design is not about getting right at once, but a process of letting ideas grow.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to my instructor, family and friends who helped and supported me through this journey! It was truly a memorable summer with you all here at LA:)</p>
