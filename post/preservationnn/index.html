<p>In any community, parks are green spaces that offer opportunities for recreation and are powerful tools to address critical urban infrastructure, health, and environmental issues vital to the well-being of communities. From expansive national parks that showcase nature's grandeur to neighborhood parks for respite, these areas foster a sense of community involvement while preserving the natural environment.<br>
Different types of parks include urban parks, national parks, state parks, historical parks, water parks, amusement parks, town square parks, etc. Each type of park differs in its purpose of usage and way of management. For example, urban parks are located within a city or town and feature areas like sports fields, walking paths, picnic areas, and sometimes tourist spots like museums. National parks are often far from urban areas and offer a wide range of recreational activities like hiking, camping, and kayaking. These parks are large lands protected by the government for perseverance.<br>

<h2 id="green-lungs-urban-parks">“Green Lungs”- Urban Parks</h2>
<p>In urban planning, a park is the heart of a bustling city, serving as a sanctuary where nature and urban life harmoniously coexist. It has the power to enhance city growth and population health by encouraging active lifestyles and strengthening local economies through job creation. Parks also benefit the environment by controlling air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities. Urban parks provide public areas for hosting social events and engaging in physical activities. Their essence as public spaces intertwined with connections to nature is akin to Legos without instruction guides, offering numerous possible activities within the space.<br>

<p>Since parks are so crucial as the 'green lungs' of cities in creating a sustainable environment, the necessity of park protection is underscored. By maintaining their cleanliness and safety, we ensure that parks continue to enliven the city. This is why, when discussing the management of parks, preservation often comes to mind. However, is preservation alone enough to keep them thriving?</p>
<h2 id="miyashita-park-and-highline-park">Miyashita Park and Highline Park</h2>
<p>Miyashita Park is a &quot;three-dimensional&quot; urban park located in Tokyo, Japan. Unlike most flatly spread urban parks, Miyashita has four floors, constructed in a long, narrow form. It is a combination of a mall, hotel, and park. Miyashita Park broke the traditional boundaries between parks and commercial facilities by creating a space where commerce and nature coexist. The four floors of the building comprise a mall providing abundant shopping and dining options. On the rooftop is the park, featuring a lawn, benches, and sports and entertainment facilities such as a rock climbing wall, volleyball court, and skateboard park. Unlike traditional parks, Miyashita Park is elevated above the busy streets of Shibuya. This integration of business and park space exemplifies how commercial value and recreational areas can coexist. Under such operation, the park has become not only a place to relax but also a commercial hub that attracts residents and tourists, eventually becoming a tourism spot.<br>

<p>High Line Park is an elevated trail constructed from an abandoned railway in New York. The park stretches above the city of Manhattan, covering a total length of 2.4 kilometers. Initially, the abandoned railroad was slated for removal by the New York government. However, an association named &quot;Friends of the High Line&quot; opposed the proposal and designed this park, protecting industrial cultural heritage while generating significant profit for neighboring communities. The park utilizes a unique strategy called &quot;agri-tecture&quot; (agriculture + architecture) for its paving system, allowing weeds to grow in the sidewalk fissures. Today, the High Line is a tourist destination and a public space that integrates the park area with the neighborhood, the street, and the city. Facilities include food courts, museums, markets, and playgrounds. Visitors can enjoy unique views of New York City along the green trail while experiencing art, performances, and socialization. Operating the High Line through the integration of arts, commerce, and nature demonstrates how a park can build connections between individuals and the community.<br>

<h1 id="balancing-preservation-and-operation">Balancing Preservation and Operation</h1>
<p>Do the above cases tell us that maintenance is not as important as we thought? Certainly not; any operation strategy for parks is built on the basis of a clean and sustainable environment. But with only maintenance, parks are more like exhibits for people to appreciate. In fact, a park becomes a burden due to the need for money and labor for protection. But with operation, it is an asset that can attract more residents and tourists. Operations do not necessarily have to be complex, like how Miyashita Park and Highline Park run. It could be as simple as hosting performances, festivals, and social activities that raise interaction between individuals and the environment. These activities, which may seem insignificant, can in fact enhance involvement and belongingness in the community. Parks are not only for appreciation but also for individuals to feel the connection between themselves, the city, nature, and the world. With maintenance, we preserve their beauty. With operation, we keep them lively.</p>
